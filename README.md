## MediBox-
#Automated Medication Reminder &amp; Storage System
Designed and developed a prototype smart medicine box that ensures drug efficacy by continuously monitoring internal temperature and humidity, alerting the user if values exceed safe limits. Integrated a reminder alarm system for scheduled doses. The IoT architecture was built with Node-RED for flow-based programming, utilized the Mosquitto MQTT protocol for data handling, and was prototyped using the Wokwi simulator.
